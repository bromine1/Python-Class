# Issues
- I don't want to get up to turn off my lights whenever I get in bed
- I have issues planning out time
- **It can be hard to plan and coordinate events with multiple people**
- Sometimes my family forgets things we meant to buy at the grocery store
- I want to bug Cole to do something ona  routine basis

# Coordinatig events issues
- Coordinating calendars can show personal information one does not want to show
- It can be difficult it  the modern world with all the events we have to coordinate less official meetings or hangouts with friends
- Many people use calendar apps to organize their events
- calendar apps have open standards 
- front end is different from the backend

# App Solutions
- An app that can anonymise calendar events to share
- Just a general calendar app
- A calendar app that automatically syncs with various calendars from different people, and anonymizes aspects (location, name, nature of event, shared people, links to join). This automatically synced calendar is then distributed as an importable group calendar so that people can just coordinate times.
