# Questions to Answer
## 1
- Date and time are its own form of data, and an address is essentially a string with syntax
- These differ in that their syntax is more agreed upon, and thus standardized.

## 2
- Within address you get buildings, street, state, zip code, and country. These data sets act as larger sections that get more and more specific onto a single location

## 3
- I might be able to use it as a framework by making date and time templates, and organizing it so that all relevant data is at the top with clear labels. This would allow me to simply write the body without having to deal with anything else
