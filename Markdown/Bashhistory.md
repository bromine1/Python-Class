# Bash 
The language I chose is the bourne again shell, or Bash

2. How long has it been in use?
## History
- Bash has been in use since around 1989
- The program acts as a general shell meant for interacting with the operating system and scripting. 
- What was different for Bash was that it was one of the first UNIX shells that were free and open source. It prompted widespread adoption by home users and engineers without licenses. It's open source nature allowed a vast number of contributions to be made in a short amount of time, speeding up its growth compared to competitors.
- Bas was very influential in it's open nature, and its wide adoption in linux systems, and MacOS until 2019, had many shells aiming to be similar or compatible in its development. Bash was designed to be POSIX  complient, however, so following compatibility isn't necessarily hard or revolutionary
